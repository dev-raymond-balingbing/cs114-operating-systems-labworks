# Machine Exercise No.1  
In Lecture 2, we described a program that copies the contents of one file to a destination file.
This program works by first prompting the user for the name of the source and destination files.
Write two versions of this program, one using the POSIX API and the other using standard C
library functions only. Be sure to include all necessary error checking, including ensuring that
the source file exists.
Once you have correctly designed and tested the programs, run the program using a utility that
traces system calls. Linux systems provide the strace utility. Using strace, generate the trace
files for these programs and compare the system calls used.
